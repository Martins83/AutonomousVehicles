# Agent-based Framework for Self-Organization of Collective and Autonomous Shuttle Fleets

The mobility of people is at the center of transportation planning and decision-making of the cities of the future. In order to accelerate the transition to zero-emissions and to maximize air quality benefits, smart  cities  are  prioritizing  walking, cycling, shared mobility services and public  transport over the use of private cars. 
Extensive progress has been made in autonomous and electric cars. Autonomous Vehicles (AV)  are  increasingly capable  of  moving  without  full  control  of humans, automating some aspects of driving, such as steering or braking.
For these reasons,  cities are  investing  in  the  infrastructure  and technology needed to support connected, multi-modal transit networks  that  include shared  electric Autonomous Vehicles (AV). 

The relationship between traditional public transport and new mobility services is in the spotlight and need to be rethought.   
This work proposes an agent-based simulation framework that allows for the creation and simulation of mobility scenarios to investigate the impact of new mobility modes on a city daily life. It lets traffic planners explore the cooperative integration of autonomous vehicles using a decentralized control approach. A prototype has been implemented and validated with data of the city of Trento.

## Installation

The IDE used for the development was GAMA 1.7.
You can find a guide for the installation [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Installation).

## Usage

The project is made by the two following directories:
 * <b>includes</b>: original GIS data and GIS data after parsing.
 * <b>models</b>: scripts to create a map that can be used in the system from raw GIS data,
    scripts for the decentralised simulation.
